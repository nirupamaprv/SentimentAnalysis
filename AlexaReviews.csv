I called Amazon customer service, and I dunno what it is, but lately I’ve been getting terrible support. The guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and I ended up setting up the Dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.I’m not sure if this is the norm or if it’s because this is refurbished, but the Dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5GHz connection is strong. Reconnecting is a pain each time as well.All that said, when Alexa works, she works amazingly well. I don’t have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing I really enjoy is the mic’s range and sensitivity. One of the more annoying limitations of Apple’s Siri is that when she’s playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the “Hey Siri” feature is all but useless. Alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. I haven’t tried this with louder speakers yet, so I’m not sure if this will continue to hold true.Setting up Alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations — support for Arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your LED devices (eg. rainbow effects), Alexa can’t handle them, she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels.All in all, my rating would’ve been lower had I not gotten a decent price on this item.

4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,"It's not perfect, but I really like this little gizmo. i bought it primarily for 2 purposes. First, so I could set wake-up alarms by individual days, and set the wake-up music individually by the day. Second, I wanted to control a bedroom light by voice, so I could shut it off as I was falling asleep, without having to get out of bed to turn a switch.

5,21-Jul-18,Black  Spot,"I got this on Prime day and figured I'd see what all the hype is about.  Honestly I didn't really want to like it as personally bugging my house seems kinda weird, but honestly, I love it.  Like it or not this is the way the world is going, so why not.I loved it so much I ordered 2.  I didn't get the Show because it looks like it came from the 1990's and is downright ugly.  I have no interest on watching anything on these devices anyway, so the Spot's screen does not bother me - although it is very clear.Alexa can hear you from pretty much everywhere.  My favorite part about this is having it in our living room where it's hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar - where I can just say play any song I want and it will.  I guess I could just pick up my smartphone to do that, but you don't know how much easier it is to interact with media using your voice rather than navigating through multiple pages.The one thing that I am not a fan of is the home screen cards do not really rotate that much - they also do not rotate when playing music.  I'd love for it to display the weather as I listen to music.The screen is clear and I also really enjoy Alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be - there is a great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to 5 different places (that you program and name) so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parents - and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic.  I have this programmed for my parents, fiances parents, work, and her work.  So it really works great.The one thing that I actually preferred the Dot over the Spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications.. I have not seen the Spot really do much for package notifications yet.  The dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered.  I would recommend Amazon do exactly what they did for the Dot but on the Spot - the Dot lights up colors - why can't the Spot ?  The same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring, just make that ring yellow when a package is updated for delivery.Overall it's a great device that I am looking forward to integrating my home around.  I'm already looking at dash buttons, smart plugs, etc..- and = when I become a home owner instead of renting where I can't tinker with my thermostat I will be purchasing a Nest down the road for HVAC integration.",1,"got,,,Prime,day,,figured,I,'d,see,,,,hype,,,.,Honestly,I,,n't,really,want,,like,,,personally,bugging,,house,seems,kinda,weird,,,,honestly,,,I,love,,.,Like,,,,,,,way,,world,,going,,,,,not.I,loved,,,much,I,ordered,2,.,I,,n't,get,,Show,,,looks,like,,came,,,1990,'s,,,downright,ugly,.,I,,,interest,,watching,anything,,,devices,anyway,,,,,Spot,'s,screen,,,bother,,-,although,,,,clear.Alexa,,hear,,,pretty,much,everywhere,.,My,favorite,part,,,,,,,,living,room,,,'s,hooked,,,,bluetooth,soundbar,-,,I,,,say,play,,song,I,want,,,,.,I,guess,I,could,,pick,,,smartphone,,,,,,,,,n't,know,,much,easier,,,,interact,,media,using,,voice,rather,,navigating,,multiple,pages.The,one,thing,,I,,,,fan,,,,home,screen,cards,,,really,rotate,,much,-,,also,,,rotate,,playing,music,.,I,'d,love,,,,display,,weather,,I,listen,,music.The,screen,,clear,,I,also,really,enjoy,Alexa,,able,,tell,,,,commute,,,-,,,,great,skill,,,,download,,,tell,,traffic,,5,different,places,(,,,program,,name,),,,,say,alexa,give,,traffic,,,parents,-,,,,tell,,,best,route,,time,,,arrive,,current,traffic,.,I,,,programmed,,,parents,,,fiances,parents,,,work,,,,,work,.,So,,really,works,great.The,one,thing,,I,actually,preferred,,Dot,,,Spot,,,dot,,light,,different,colors,,,,package,notifications,..,I,,,seen,,Spot,really,,much,,package,notifications,yet,.,The,dot,,,,easy,,tell,,something,,delivered,.,I,would,recommend,Amazon,,exactly,,,,,,Dot,,,,Spot,-,,Dot,lights,,colors,-,,ca,n't,,Spot,?,The,,way,,command,alexa,,,get,,blue,ring,,,,make,,ring,yellow,,,package,,updated,,delivery.Overall,,'s,,great,device,,I,,looking,forward,,integrating,,home,around,.,I,'m,already,looking,,dash,buttons,,,smart,plugs,,,etc,..,-,,=,,I,become,,home,owner,instead,,renting,,I,ca,n't,tinker,,,thermostat,I,,,purchasing,,Nest,,,road,,HVAC,integration",0.9979

3,17-Jul-18,Black  Spot,"This is 1 of 6 echo devices in the house and is currently being deployed as a bedside alarm clock.  I use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video.  Audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video.  Much of the time it works well as alarm clock, but there are some serious flaws, particularly if you are the last one to bed or the first to wake.  It doesn’t seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with 2 people on different schedules.  Try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying “Alexa set an alarm for 5am” and then having Alexa repeat “OK alarm set for 5am.”  Not good.  I suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid.  Plain and simple, this device needs to be brought into the 1990’s and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm.  I know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone.  No thanks, if I’m picking up my phone to set an alarm I will just use its built in alarm and save a step.  At least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen, so for example if you wake up a few minutes early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse.  The interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great.  There should be separate snooze and cancel buttons.  Currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels.  It is too easy when half awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled.  When the snoozed alarm goes off a few minutes later, my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning Alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while I’m in the shower.",1,",1,,6,echo,devices,,,house,,,currently,,deployed,,,bedside,alarm,clock,.,I,use,,basically,,,echo,dot,,,clock,attached,,may,occasionally,pull,,camera,video,.,Audio,quality,,screen,quality,,really,,,appropriate,,music,,watching,video,.,Much,,,time,,works,well,,alarm,clock,,,,,,,serious,flaws,,,particularly,,,,,last,one,,bed,,,first,,wake,.,It,,’,,seem,like,,engineers,actually,tested,,,,bedroom,,2,people,,different,schedules,.,Try,walking,,,dark,bedroom,,,sleeping,wife,,waking,,,,saying,“,Alexa,set,,alarm,,5am,”,,,,Alexa,repeat,“,OK,alarm,set,,5am.,”,Not,good,.,I,suppose,,could,whisper,,fumble,,,volume,,button,,,,stupid,.,Plain,,simple,,,,device,needs,,,brought,,,1990,’,,,,simple,touch,screen,interface,added,,set,,alarm,.,I,know,,,,cumbersome,interface,,,situations,,one,,set,,alarm,,,alexa,app,,,phone,.,No,thanks,,,,I,’,,picking,,,phone,,set,,alarm,I,,,use,,built,,alarm,,save,,step,.,At,least,,engineers,allow,,alarm,,,turned,,,,touch,screen,,,,,example,,,wake,,,,minutes,early,,,cancel,,alarm,without,speaking,,waking,,spouse,.,The,interface,,using,,touch,screen,,cancel,,alarm,,,gone,,,however,,great,.,There,,,separate,snooze,,cancel,buttons,.,Currently,,touch,snoozes,,,swipe,cancels,.,It,,,easy,,half,awake,,snooze,,,think,,,cancelled,.,When,,snoozed,alarm,goes,,,,minutes,later,,,,,amused,,,longer,sleeping,wife,,let,,know,,summoning,Alexa,,turn,,,bathroom,lights,,I,’,,,,shower",-0.991

I also like listening to my kindle books even the ones that I didn’t purchased  audibles for. I like that it can play my music from Amazon music, pandora, tunein, I heart radio and Spotify. Echo can even play my local radio station. I love that the echo is connected to my TiVo Bolt. This allows TiVo to pause, stop and play whatever I want with a simple voice command. I love that I can reorder items that I purchased on Amazon and that the echo plus notifies me when my order is mailed, when it will be delivered and when the package has been delivered.  The only three dislikes that I have is that if you’re up too close or to far the echo doesn’t respond. So I think they need to improve the microphone. And I wish the speaker was better. The speakers are okay but could be improved. Also I have the echo dot and it never has given me any problems with the internet. Well the other day I received a Red Light Right on my Echo Plus. This error was Sorry I’m having trouble understanding you please try again later. After research online I learned it was a problem connecting to my internet. And it was easy to find this out.

3,23-Jul-18,Black  Plus,"We are a long time Amazon Prime family, many years, but new to the Alexa world and thought the purchase of Alexa Plus, with hub, and included Phillips Hue light bulb would be a great start. Alexa does a lot of good things for us like Alarm in the morning, verbalize books, playing music on command, even linked to my Sirrius/xm account. Good daily stuff. Good sound, but not Bose. But, the ads say &#34;Hub included&#34; so don't need anything else to operate devices. Well, not so. I understand there will be some differences in product device  support. The fact that it came with the Hue light bulb works only for on /off/ dimming of the bulb. The bulb is capable of so much more with the Hue App but the Hue app does not recognize Alexa hub as a bridge. So, it appears you do have to get a Philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes, time the lights when you are away, set color tones, etc. That can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home. The list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own bridge. Was very disappointed to find that out after the fact, to the point I feel we are being misled by Amazon by included the Hue bulbs without explanation.

2,21-Jul-18,Black  Plus,"I have been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited when it arrived bundled with a Philip Hue bulb.  The excited ended quickly.  I spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my Alexa Echo Plus.  Everything I tried, ended in a Discovery Failed message.  I tried to set this up over and over and over again.  I watched YouTube videos.  I read set up websites.  I was the poster child of insanity (doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results).The next day I went onto Amazon to get the tech support.  I was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error.  Well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn't work.  This product has tested my patience.  So far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school.The only reason I gave this two stars is because Amazon will be sending me a different Echo Plus and light bulb.  The problem wasn't the bulb, because before packing up the items, I purchased another bulb and still Alexa couldn't locate this device.I pray the next attempt is successful and then I will revise this rating, but what are the odds that I was shipped a defective Echo?  The support person had the same thought.  Maybe I should be exploring the Google device but I can't get over the look of that hub.

They are essentially the same in dimension, weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub. As many folks already pointed out, the hub is not a direct replacement for the Philips Hue, Z wave or anything else. It provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub. For me, the voice recognition and music play capability is the same, the original Echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers. The new Echo plus is priced lower than the original Echo with the built in hub but I don't really need the hub with less functionality. In addition, I don't think that Amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed. My Philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs FW and they fixes bugs. Net net for me, this Echo does not do anything more than the original Echo and sound quality is not as good.

5,20-Jul-18,Black  Plus,"Incredible piece of technology.I have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter. The mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. I connected the Echo via Bluetooth to my Sony soundbar on my TV but find the Echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. It's no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. The sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. The knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. This is my first Echo device and I would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the Echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. For that alone I would recommend this over the regular Echo (2nd generation).The piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. The rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.This order came with a free Philips Hue Bulb which I installed along with an extra one I bought. I put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all I had to do was say &#34;Alexa, connect my devices&#34;. The default names for each bulb was assigned as &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34;, so I can have a dimmer floor lamp if I just turned on/off one of the lights by saying &#34;Alexa, turn off the second light&#34;. In the Alexa app, I created a 'Group' with &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34; and named the group &#34;The light&#34;, so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining I just say &#34;Alexa, turn on The light&#34;.I was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the Echo Plus with its built in hub. I thought I would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. Apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! I was surprised by that. Awesome.You will feel like Tony Stark on this device. I added quite a few &#34;Skills&#34; like 'Thunderstorm sounds' and 'Quote of the day' . Alexa always loads them up quickly. Adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on Amazon Music is also a great feature.I can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.I was lucky to buy this for $100 on Prime Day, but I think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the Echo 2 is only $100. In my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the Echo Plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:1) Taller and 360 sound unit.2) Volume knob on top that you spin (I think this is a huge benefit over buttons)3) Built in hub for Hue bulbs. After researching more, there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups.

Wireless connection has proved almost flawless so far. A few brief hiccups here and there, but I'm convinced that was from the Apps themselves. Don't miss the ridiculously high cable prices and am able to watch most of what I used to watch for a much lower price, which right now is a total of $50 a month. Amazon Fire Stick is limited to 1GB of memory and 8GB of storage. Thought that would be a huge issue when it came to downloading Apps and recording shows. So far it hasn't been any issue at all. The upcoming fall tv schedule, which includes the return of NFL Football, might prove more troublesome when I need to record more often. I'll worry about that then. My only real issue is that you can't really turn it off. The screen remains on and uses up electricity, although probably small amounts. Luckily when you unplug it, all downloaded Apps and recorded shows stay in memory. Not sure what happens when you have something scheduled to record when it's unplugged. Haven't tried it yet, although I don't think it'll be an issue with DirectTV Now, which I'm using right now. So far I'm loving the Amazon Fire Stick. Actually love that Amazon, which I use occasionally, come pre-installed.",1,"cut,,cord,,cable,television,.,Needed,,easy,,install,,relatively,inexpensive,alternative,option,,fill,,gap,.,Ordered,,Amazon,Fire,Stick,,Best,Buy,.,Instructions,,short,,easy,,follow,.,I,,going,,order,,Amazon,Ethernet,Adapter,,I,,worried,,wireless,speeds,,,area,,,,thought,I,'d,wait,,see,.,Glad,I,,.,Wireless,connection,,proved,almost,flawless,,far,.,A,,brief,hiccups,,,,,,,I,'m,convinced,,,,,Apps,,.,Do,n't,miss,,ridiculously,high,cable,prices,,,able,,watch,,,,I,used,,watch,,,much,lower,price,,,,right,,,,total,,$,50,,month,.,Amazon,Fire,Stick,,limited,,1GB,,memory,,8GB,,storage,.,Thought,,would,,,huge,issue,,,came,,downloading,Apps,,recording,shows,.,So,far,,,n't,,,issue,,,.,The,upcoming,fall,tv,schedule,,,,includes,,return,,NFL,Football,,,might,prove,,troublesome,,I,need,,record,,often,.,I,'ll,worry,,,,.,My,,real,issue,,,,ca,n't,really,turn,,,.,The,screen,remains,,,uses,,electricity,,,although,probably,small,amounts,.,Luckily,,,unplug,,,,,downloaded,Apps,,recorded,shows,stay,,memory,.,Not,sure,,happens,,,,something,scheduled,,record,,,'s,unplugged,.,Have,n't,tried,,yet,,,although,I,,n't,think,,'ll,,,issue,,DirectTV,Now,,,,I,'m,using,right,,.,So,far,I,'m,loving,,Amazon,Fire,Stick,.,Actually,love,,Amazon,,,,I,use,occasionally,,,come,pre-installed",0.9694

First, I didn’t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don’t like that it’s not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don’t. Lastly, I’m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven’t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful.
